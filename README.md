I'm thrilled to introduce a project I've poured my heart into: my very own Airbnb app!

Background
As a computer science student, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and hospitality. With the rise of the sharing economy, Airbnb has revolutionized the way we travel and experience new places. Inspired by this, I embarked on a journey to develop an Airbnb app that enhances the overall user experience.

Key Features:
Authentication and Authorization
1.Technologies Used: Node.js, Express, Passport.js
2.Details: I implemented robust authentication and authorization systems to ensure secure user access and protect sensitive data. Passport.js facilitated easy integration with various authentication strategies, such as OAuth, providing a seamless login experience for users.

Database Management:
Technologies Used: MongoDB
Details: I designed a flexible and scalable database schema to efficiently store and manage property listings, user profiles, and booking information.

Cloud Storage
Technologies Used: Cloudinary
Details: Integrated cloud-based image storage solutions to ensure seamless performance and fast loading times for property images.

Geocoding
Technologies Used: Mapbox
Details: Enhanced the app's user-friendliness by providing accurate location data and interactive maps, making it easier for users to find and book their ideal accommodations.

Review System
Details: The app includes a comprehensive review system that allows users to leave feedback and ratings for their stays, enhancing trust and transparency within the community.

Ongoing Development
While the app has already achieved significant milestones, there are still exciting functionalities in the pipeline:

Messaging System
Details: Implementing a real-time messaging system to facilitate communication between hosts and guests.
Enhanced Search Filters
Details: Introducing advanced search filters to allow users to find properties based on specific criteria, such as price range, amenities, and location preferences.
